# Textfield in Flutter

A TextField in Flutter is a Material Design widget that allows users to enter text. TextField widgets are typically used to collect user input, such as their name, email address, or password.

To create a TextField in Flutter, you can use the TextField widget. The TextField widget takes a number of properties, including:

- controller: A TextEditingController object that controls the text in the TextField.
- decoration: An InputDecoration object that defines the decoration of the TextField, such as the label, hint text, and error text.
- keyboardType: The type of keyboard that is displayed when the TextField is focused.
- maxLength: The maximum length of the text that can be entered into the TextField.
- onChanged: A callback function that is called when the text in the TextField changes.
